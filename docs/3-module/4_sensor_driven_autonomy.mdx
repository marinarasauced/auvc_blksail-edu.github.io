# 3.3 Sensor-Driven Autonomy

## Gazebo

[Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/) is a set of open source tools for simulating robots in an environment.
It is commonly used in robotics research and education.

We will be using Gazebo to simulate the BlueROV2 robot in a virtual pool environment.

:::note

We will be using `Gazebo Harmonic`, the latest LTS version of Gazebo.

:::

### Installation

The documentation for installing Gazebo can be found [here](https://gazebosim.org/docs/garden/install).
See "**Binary Installation**" for instructions on installing Gazebo on your operating system.
Below is a summary of the steps.

:::note

Only Ubuntu is fully supported by Gazebo, and macOS is partially supported.
On Windows the simulation will run in the WSL environment.

:::

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

First we need to install ruby from Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ruby
```

Then we have to add the Homebrew Ruby to our path:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$(brew --prefix)/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Now, we add the `osrf/simulation` tap:

```bash
brew tap osrf/simulation
```

:::tip Apple Silicon-based Macs

For Apple Silicon-based Macs, we need to modify the Formulae before installing Gazebo.

```bash
cd /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/osrf/homebrew-simulation/Formula
sed -i '' 's|cmake_args << "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH=#{rpath}"|cmake_args << "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH=#{rpath};/opt/homebrew/lib"|' *.rb
```

:::

Next we install Gazebo:

```bash
brew install gz-harmonic
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

First, **in a WSL terminal**, update and install dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lsb-release wget gnupg
```

Next, install the Gazebo package repository:

```bash
sudo wget https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.gpg -O /usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list > /dev/null
```

Finally, install `Gazebo Harmonic`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gz-harmonic
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Testing

To test your installation, run the following command:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

In one terminal, run:

```bash
gz sim -v4 -s shapes.sdf
```

In another terminal, run:

```bash
gz sim -v4 -g
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

In one terminal, run:

```bash
gz sim -v4 shapes.sdf
```

You should see a window pop up with some 3D objects in it.

:::info

For **`WSL`** users, hardware acceleration (GPU) may not work properly inside of the virtual environment. If your simulation seems laggy, you can try switching to software acceleration (CPU).

To do so, add the following line to your `WSL`'s `.zshrc` file:

```zsh
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1
```

Then, source `.zshrc` in your `WSL` terminal and restart the simulation.

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

## BlueROV2 Simulation

### Installation

In this course, you will use a custom simulation for the BlueROV2. To install the simulation, **clone the repository onto your macOs, Windows WSL, or Ubuntu machine**:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/blksail-edu/gazebo_bluerov2
```

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

Dr. Saad it is your time to shine !

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

Install the following dependencies:

```zsh
sudo apt install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev rapidjson-dev libopencv-dev
```

Navigate to the `gazebo_bluerov2` repository, and then run the build command:

```zsh
chmod +x ./build.sh
./build.sh
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Testing

After the build is complete, you can start the simulation with:

```zsh
chmod +x ./launch_1x_bluerov2.sh
./launch_1x_bluerov2.sh
```

:::info

The `./` in the command is the relative path to the `build.sh` and `launch.sh` files. As is, the above commands only run if your working directory is the `gaebo_bluerov2` directory.

This command **MUST** be run from inside the `/gazebo_bluerov2` directory.
:::

### Environment Setup

Now that you can run the BlueROV2 Gazebo simulation, the Gazebo simulation must be bridged with ROS 2.

#### Raspberry Pi Configuration

In a terminal on the `backseat`, install the `ros_gz_bridge` package. First, add the Gazebo package repository:

```zsh
sudo wget https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.gpg -O /usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list > /dev/null
```

Then install the bridge and some dependencies:

```zsh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-ros-gz ros-jazzy-ros-gz-bridge libgz-transport13-dev libgz-msgs10-dev libgz-common5-dev libgz-tools2-dev
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Then, with your favorite text editor, open the `.zshrc` file and add the following lines:

```zsh
# Gazebo
export GZ_PARTITION=my_sim
export GZ_TRANSPORT_IP=192.168.3.2
export GZ_TRANSPORT_PUB_PORT=11345
export GZ_TRANSPORT_SUB_PORT=11346
export GZ_DISCOVERY_SERVER=192.168.3.1:11345
```

These environment variables will help point the Raspberry Pi to the Gazebo simulation.

Source the `.zshrc` file:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### Laptop Configuration

:::warning

If you are using **Windows and WSL**, then for this section only, follow the Windows tab rather than the Ubuntu tab.

:::

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

:::danger

Dr. Saad part two, electric boogaloo !

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

You must add similar environment variables to your `WSL`'s `.zshrc` file so that Raspberry Pi and Gazebo simulation can communicate. With your favorite text editor, open the `.zshrc` file in `WSL` and add the following lines:

```zsh
# Gazebo
export GZ_PARTITION=my_sim
export GZ_TRANSPORT_ID=192.168.3.1
export GZ_TRANSPORT_PUB_PORT=11345
export GZ_TRANSPORT_SUB_PORT=11346
```

After, source the `.zshrc` file:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

This alone is not enough to enable Gazebo communication between your Raspberry Pi and WSL.

##### WSL Network Mode

Since WSL is a virtual machine, it is by default an internal network interface, meaning that the WSL interface is only visible to Windows. To fix this, you can change WSL's network mode to mirrored.

In a **`Windows PowerShell`** terminal, open the `.wslconfig file`:

```zsh
cd
notepad .wslconfig
```

:::note

If it says that the file does not exist, please click yes to create a new file.

:::

Insert the following lines to change WSL to have a `mirror` network mode, then save and close the file.

```zsh
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
```

To apply the changes, shutdown `WSL` from a **`Windows PowerShell`** terminal:

:::warning

This will close all running `WSL` terminals in your system.

:::

```zsh
wsl --shutdown
```

After the shutdown, you can open `WSL` again as normal and the changes will be applied. However, you are still not done.

##### WSL Firewall Access

Create a new Windows Firewall protocol to enable IPv4 communication between WSL and your Raspberry Pi. In a **`Windows PowerShell`** terminal, run:

```zsh
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "AUVC Allow ICMPv4 Inbound for WSL2" -Direction Inbound -Protocol ICMPv4 -Action Allow
```

You can test that this works by pinging your Raspberry Pi. In a **`WSL`** terminal, run:

```zsh
ping 192.168.3.2
```

Then, create four additional Windows Firewall protocols to allow access to the Gazebo ports. Run the following commands in a **`Windows PowerShell`** terminal:

```zsh
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "AUVC Allow Gazebo UDP Ports Inbound for WSL2" -Direction Inbound -Protocol UDP -LocalPort 9000-9100,10317-10318,11345-11355 -Action Allow
```

```zsh
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "AUVC Allow Gazebo UDP Ports Outbound for WSL2" -Direction Outbound -Protocol UDP -RemotePort 9000-9100,10317-10318,11345-11355 -Action Allow
```

```zsh
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "AUVC Allow Gazebo TCP Ports Inbound for WSL2" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 40000-65535 -Action Allow
```

```zsh
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "AUVC Allow Gazebo TCP Ports Outbound for WSL2" -Direction Outbound -Protocol TCP -RemotePort 40000-65535 -Action Allow
```

You can test that this is working by running the Gazebo `./launch_1x_bluerov2.sh` simulation in a `WSL` terminal, and then running the following command from your Raspberry Pi:

```zsh
gz topic -l
```

You should see a list of Gazebo topics in your terminal on the `backseat` from the Gazebo simulation running in `WSL`.

In the same terminal on the `backseat`, try:

```zsh
gz topic -e -t /world/bluerov2_pool_sim/model/rov1/link/base_link/sensor/imu_sensor/imu
```

You should see imu messages output in the terminal.

## ROS 2 Gazebo Bridge

To communicate with the BlueROV2 simulation, you will use the `ros_gz_bridge` package. The `rosmav` package contains a launch file that is already configured for both our single-rov and double-rov simulations.

:::warning

The bridge node should be started after the Gazebo simulations to ensure it functions properly.

:::

This node will convert Gazebo messages to ROS 2 messages for crucial onboard components like the camera, IMU, magnetometer/compass. It is also configured for thruster manual inputs; however, we **WILL NOT** be using these to control the ROV(s).

:::info

You will start the bridge in the `simulation.launch.py` ROS 2 launch file in the following section.

:::

## ROS 2 Simulation Interface

To control the BlueROV2 vehicle(s) in the Gazebo simulations, you will use the simulation interface in the `rosmav` package. The simulation interface publishes topics identical to those from the hardware interface using a custom node paired with the `ros_gz_bridge` package.

First, **start the simulation on your macOs, Windows WSL, or Ubuntu machine**:

:::info

If you want to start a simulation with **1x BlueROV2**, run:

```zsh
./launch_1x_bluerov2.sh
```

If you want to start a simulation with **2x BlueROV2**, run:

```zsh
./launch_2x_bluerov2.sh
```

:::

Then, on the `backseat`, launch the simulation interface and bridge nodes:

```zsh
ros2 launch rosmav simulation.launch.py
```

If all things are working correctly, several topics will be advertised with the `rov1` and `rov2` namespaces that correspond to the same topics from the `bluerov2_hardware_interface` node.

:::note

Topics will be advertised for both ROVs in the simulation interface regardless of whether you are simulating 1x or 2x vehicles.

If you are only simulating 1x vehicle, ignore the `rov2` topics.

:::

:::info

For the simulation, you do not need to arm the ROVs to publish `ManualControl` messages.

:::

## Problem Set

Create a new package that will contain nodes to run with the Gazebo simulations.

### Problem One

Create a new node that deploys your line-following logic with `rov1` in the `./launch_1x_bluerov2` simulation. Publish control messages to the `/rov1/manual_control` topic.

:::info

If you do not want to publish all the `x`, `y`, `z`, and `r` in a single `ManualControl` msg, you can replace any of the fields with `nan`. In this case, the software interface will use the previous value for that field.

:::

:::warning Check-off
Review with a TA or instructor to check-off this section.
:::

### Problem Two

Create a launch file that deploys two instances of your control logic for both `rov1` and `rov2`. Please specify the ROV names as namespaces in your launch file.

Then, test your code using the `./launch_2x_bluerov2` simulation and `ros2 launch rosmav simulation.launch.py`.

:::note

This simulation can be used to test your strategy for the final challenge.
