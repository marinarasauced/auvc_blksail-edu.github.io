# Connecting RPi to Wifi

To connect your Raspberry Pi to the internet, you will need to modify the `50-cloud-init.yaml` file. Open a terminal on the `backseat` and open the file:

```zsh
sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```
:::warning

Any mistyped characters or any extra spaces will break the network connections. If this occurs, you may not be able to SSH into your Raspberry Pi, so please follow these instructions very carefully.

:::

When you open this file, it will look something like this:

```yaml
network:
    ethernets:
        usb0:
            dhcp4: false
            dhcp6: false
            link-local:
            - ipv4
            match:
                name: usb0
            set-name: usb0
    version: 2
    wifis:
        renderer: networkd
        wlan0:
            access-points:
                MIT:
                    password: MIT_PASSWORD
            dhcp4: true
            optional: true
```

To add your home wifi network, add a new `wlan0` interface to wifis at the bottom of the file:

```yaml
    wlan0:
        access-points:
            HOME_WIFI:
                password: YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_PASSWORD
        dhcp4: true
        optional: true
```

Change `HOME_WIFI` to the name of your home wifi network. Also change `YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_PASSWORD` to your home wifi network's password.

:::danger

Before closing your file, please ensure that the new lines have the same number of spaces and no incorrect characters. If there are, you may not be able to SSH into your RPi and the TAs must fix it in class.

:::

Once you are sure that your file has no formatting mistakes, apply the netplan. This will likely close your SSH connection.

:::note

At the bottom of the terminal, there will be instructions to save and close the file. It should appear like CTRL or CMD + S to save the file and CTRL or CMD + X to close the file.

:::

To apply your changes:

```zsh
sudo netplan apply
```
